# Jamming  web application, Spotify API

I made this app during a course "Build Front-End Web Applications from Scratch". Main goal was to get to know Ract library and use it to build an app using Spotify API. App works fine and you can easily use it.

By this app you can make your personal playlist, search for songs and add them to playlist and then save it to your Spotify account.

Hope your going to enjoy it
